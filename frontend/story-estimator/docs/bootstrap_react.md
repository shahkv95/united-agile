# Create a React app using the create-react-app tool

## Steps

1. Go to the root directory of the project and create a directory called as backend.

```
mkdir frontend && cd frontend
```

2. Install Node.js:

- Go to the official website of Node.js (https://nodejs.org/) and download the latest stable version.
- Follow the installation instructions to install Node.js on your system.

3. Install the create-react-app tool:

```
npm install -g create-react-app
create-react-app <app-name>
```

4. Start the development server: Navigate to the app directory and run the following command:

```
cd my-app
npm start
```

This will start the development server and open the app in your default browser. 5. Build the app for production:
When you are ready to deploy the app, run the following command to build the app for production:

```
npm run build
```

This will create a production-ready build of the app in the "build" directory.

# The React project is bootstrapped.
